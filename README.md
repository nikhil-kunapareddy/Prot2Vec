# Protein Sequence Vectorization

## Project Summary
This project explores and evaluates existing **protein sequence vectorization techniques** with the goal of understanding how well they capture structural and functional similarity in biological sequences. By comparing different embedding strategies, the project benchmarks their effectiveness across core bioinformatics tasks.

## Motivation
Proteins are fundamental to biological systems, and representing them in a way that computational models can interpret is critical for tasks like clustering, similarity search, and functional annotation. This project focuses on:
- **Clustering**: Grouping proteins into biologically meaningful families or domains  
- **Similarity Search**: Identifying related proteins based on embeddings  
- **Biological Context**: Ensuring embeddings align with known biological structures and functions  

## Datasets
- **Pfam**: A comprehensive database of protein families and domains (~20,000 families, millions of sequences)  
- Additional datasets may be incorporated for benchmarking depending on scope  

## Risks & Challenges
- **Benchmarking Issues**: Lack of a universal gold standard for evaluating embeddings  
- **Generalizability**: Models may fail on proteins outside training families  
- **Interpretability**: Difficult to connect embedding dimensions to biological meaning  
- **Computational Cost**: Embedding millions of protein sequences is resource-intensive  

## Example Research Questions
- How well do vectorization techniques separate proteins by family or domain?  
- How consistent are embedding-based similarity searches with curated databases like Pfam?  
- What trade-offs exist between computational efficiency and biological insight across different methods?  

## Roadmap
1. Implement baseline vectorization methods (one-hot, k-mers)  
2. Integrate protein language model embeddings (e.g., ProtBERT, ESM)  
3. Benchmark clustering and similarity search performance  
4. Analyze trade-offs in interpretability and scalability
